# Mastering Embedded Systems Diploma

## Description

The [Mastering Embedded Systems Diploma](https://www.learn-in-depth.com/) under the supervision of [Eng. Keroles Shenouda](https://github.com/keroles) focuses on embedded C code, writing drivers for MCU peripherals and communication protocols, and other embedded systems topics.

This repository allows me to track my progress during the diploma by including all my `Assignments`, `Labs`, `Projects`, and other `Practice Codes`.

All files are written in `ANSI C Standard` (C89).
